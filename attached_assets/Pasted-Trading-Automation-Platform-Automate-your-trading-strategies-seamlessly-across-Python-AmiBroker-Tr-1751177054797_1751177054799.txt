Trading Automation Platform
Automate your trading strategies seamlessly across Python, AmiBroker, TradingView, and Excel—enabling consistent, fast execution and reliable risk management.

1. Overview
Unified Execution: Central Python engine enforces consistent risk rules (SL/TP/TSL) regardless of signal source.

Multi‐Channel Signals: Support for AFL alerts (AmiBroker), Pine Script webhooks (TradingView), and spreadsheet triggers (Excel).

Broker API Integration: Connect to Shoonya, Zerodha, Fyers, and other brokers for live order placement and position management.

2. Core Components & Workflows
• Python Command‐Line Interface (CLI)

Real‐Time Data Feeds: Subscribes to WebSocket or REST endpoints for LTP updates on chosen instruments (Nifty, Bank Nifty, stocks).

Strategy Modules: Drop in custom Python files (e.g., ema_strategy.py, vwap_supertrend.py) implementing a standardized generate_signals() function.

Automated Order Placement: Executes market or limit orders via broker SDKs, with built‐in retry logic and fill confirmation.

Risk Management: Enforces configurable stop‐loss, take‐profit, trailing stop, and position‐sizing rules before sending any trade.

Logging & Reporting: Writes detailed CSV or database logs for all signals, fills, and P&L; generates end‐of‐day summary reports.

• AmiBroker Integration (AFL → Python)

AmiBroker Alerts: Write or modify AFL strategies; when a signal condition triggers (e.g., “EMA(5) crosses above EMA(20)”), AmiBroker emits an alert.

Plugin/COM Listener: A lightweight AmiBroker plugin (or COM script) monitors alerts, exports them as JSON or calls the Python CLI REST endpoint.

Seamless Handoff: The Python CLI picks up the AFL‐generated signal payload (symbol, action, quantity), applies risk checks, and places the live order.

Backtest Alignment: Use the same AFL code for historical backtesting in AmiBroker, then trust the live signals for zero discrepancies.

• TradingView Webhook Integration (Pine Script → Python)

Pine Script Strategies: Create or import TradingView strategies (e.g., breakout, VWAP cross) that trigger alerts upon bar close or tick.

Webhook Alerts: Configure TradingView to send JSON payloads (symbol, side, price) to your Python CLI server’s public endpoint (e.g., https://yourserver.com/webhook).

Flask/Django Microservice: A simple Python microservice verifies payload signatures, transforms the data into CLI‐compatible format, and queues the trade request.

Automated Execution: The CLI worker consumes the queued signal, runs risk heuristics, and sends the order through the broker API—no manual intervention required.

• Excel‐Based Automation (VBA/xlwings → Python)

Live Data & Indicators: Populate Excel via RTD/DDE plugins or manual CSV imports. Derive indicators (e.g., EMA, RSI) using cell formulas.

Signal Cells: Use simple IF formulas (e.g., =IF(B2>C2,"BUY","")) to flag entry/exit points in designated columns.

VBA or xlwings Bridge:

VBA Approach: A macro runs on a scheduled timer (e.g., every minute), reads signal cells, and sends HTTP POST requests to the Python CLI REST endpoint.

xlwings Approach: A Python script monitors the spreadsheet directly—reading signal cells, executing trades, and writing back fill prices or errors to dedicated cells.

Spreadsheet Dashboard: Track positions, real‐time P&L, and execution history in Excel—perfect for traders comfortable with spreadsheets.

3. Key Features & Benefits
Multi‐Environment Flexibility:

Code strategies in Python for complex quant logic.

Leverage existing AFL codebases in AmiBroker without rewriting.

Use TradingView’s charting interface and community scripts.

Rapidly prototype ideas in Excel with zero‐code formulas.

Consistent Risk Controls:

Centralized enforcement of stop‐loss, take‐profit, and trailing stops.

Prevents divergent behaviors across platforms—one rule set drives all executions.

Faster Iteration & Deployment:

Backtest in AmiBroker or TradingView, then push live with minimal configuration.

Modify Excel formulas to test new entry conditions instantly.

No need to recompile or redeploy large applications—Python CLI reloads strategies dynamically.

Scalable & Headless Operation:

Run the Python CLI on any Linux/Windows server or cloud VM (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean).

Auto‐restart and health‐check logic ensure uninterrupted 24×7 trading.

Easily add new broker integrations or feed sources by dropping in connector modules.

Centralized Logging & Analytics:

All signals, fills, and errors are logged to CSV files, SQL databases, or NoSQL stores.

Generate daily/weekly P&L reports, drawdown analyses, and broker commission breakdowns from a single source of truth.

4. Typical Deployment Workflow
Clone the Starter Kit

GitHub repo contains:

Python CLI core (main.py, strategies/, config_template.yaml)

AmiBroker plugin + AFL example scripts

Pine Script examples with webhook JSON templates

Excel workbook with VBA and xlwings samples

Configure Broker Credentials

Copy config_template.yaml → config.yaml and fill in your Shoonya/Zerodha API keys, account IDs, and other parameters (e.g., default lot size).

Develop or Import Strategies

Place Python strategy files into strategies/ (implement generate_signals(data)).

Adapt AFL scripts and add to AmiBroker with webhook or file export settings.

Write or tweak Pine Script alerts in TradingView; point to your CLI’s https://yourserver.com/webhook.

Build Excel formulas and configure VBA to POST to http://localhost:5000/signal.

Run in Paper Mode

Execute:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py --mode paper
The CLI will fetch live data, simulate order placements, and log hypothetical fills to logs/. Verify indicator alignment and risk checks.

Go Live

Update config.yaml to mode: live; deploy the CLI on a dedicated server or VM with a process manager (e.g., Supervisor or systemd).

Ensure ports are open for AmiBroker and TradingView webhooks (HTTPS recommended).

Monitor logs and set up email/SMS alerts for exceptions or order rejections.

5. Summary of Benefits
Reduced Manual Errors: No more copy‐pasting orders—automation enforces discipline and speed.

Emotional Discipline: Rules‐based execution removes human hesitation under volatile conditions.

Faster Response: Automated market orders execute within milliseconds of signal generation.

Effortless Scaling: From one script and one instrument to dozens, the same Python core handles all.

Holistic Insights: Consolidated logs allow for deeper analytics—optimize strategies based on real execution data, not just backtests.
